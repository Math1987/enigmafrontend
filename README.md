## Into

Enigma JDR is an indie rpg turn-based browser game.
Inspired from the survival game "hordes", you get each day actions and movements to spend in a map.
You can choose a race between human, dwarf, vampire or elf and a religion giving you specifics magics spells.
Find values, plant trees, get materials, protect you're territory, build fortifications, attack squeletons or enemy.

the game is powered with the framework angular for the front end and node js for the back end.

## Backend connection in localhost

Grab the back-end server at Math1987/enigmabackend.
Install the dependencies with npm i.
Setup a local MySQL database named enigma_db, accessible with a passwordless root user. (The easiest way to do this on Windows is with a basic Wamp installation)
Start the server with npm run dev.

## Front-end

Install the dependencies with npm i.
Run npm run start to start the front-end locally.
Navigate to http://localhost:4200/.
The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Note: If you don't wan't to open the back-end workspace everytime you work on the front-end, you can simply run npm run backend within your front-end workspace if you installed the back-end in the same folder as the front-end. This will start the back-end server.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
